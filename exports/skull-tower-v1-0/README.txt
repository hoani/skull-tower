Development notes:

    I have been watching a lot of videos on gameboy development lately...
    This time around I decided to challenge myself by having gameboy style graphics:
    * Only three colors + transparency (for most sprites)
    * Limited color palete - I settled on only 16 colors using this palette https://lospec.com/palette-list/16-bital
    * No alpha blending

    I've also recently been playing Celeste... so some clear influences there in the platforming.

    Originally, I was going to give the hero only two health, and on the lower health they would be in adrenaline mode...
    But I realized it was more adrenaline inducing having only one health.
