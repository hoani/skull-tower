Skull Tower v2.1
    by Hoani Bryson

Skull Tower v2.1 is a post-jam release of a game I made for the GMC 55 Jam.

The changes in this game were heavily influenced by both things that I couldn't fit in the timeframe of the jam, but also feedback I received from the GMC community when playing my game. 

I'm very greatful to the GMC folks for spending time playing my jam entry and helping me find way to improve.

I hope you have fun :D

Major changes since the Jam release:
    * Autosaving, you can now continue from the last stage you stopped playing on 
    * Overhaul on character movement
        * Wall jumps have better movement and input buffering
        * Jumps use an apex modifier (gravity is slower at the peak of the jump) to assist in player control
        * Better turning in both the air and on ground
        * Character clips around corners for smoother air movement
    * Level design
        * Tweaked the layout of levels and split many levels into two to make them less frustrating
        * Improved tutorial levels to only focus on the technique being taught
    * Bosses
        * Every boss (except sloth) now has additional elements or modes to thier fight
    * Aesthetic things
        * Better sound feedback on character movement (inspired by watching videos of Super Meatboy)
        * Character does a flip at the peak of the jump
        * Lots more background art to make the castle feel cooler
